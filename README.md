- 👋 Hi, username @bihhplzz aka mj aka idgaf
- 👀 I’m interested in looking at the world from the outside in ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about emotions and what is real and my delusions ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a cure for my personality disorder ...
- 📫 How to reach me: don't ... but if you must, just know I wasted ALOT of brain cells self medicating
                                and now my psychiatrist insist on slowing brain function to keep me docile,
                                I will do my best to contribute.
